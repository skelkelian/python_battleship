# BattleShip

I programmed the game Battleship. Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. Each player has a board on which each player's fleet of ships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

# Motivation

I made this project to learn the basics of Python. I am a Mechanical Engineer undergraduate who has found a passion for Computer Science. I programmed the game Battleship in my MATLAB class last semester and converted the syntax to Python syntax and had a working game in Python. Now, with the help of my uncle I am learning OOP.
